## Human Activity Recognition using CNN in Keras
This project is to create a small and simple Convolutional Neural Network for Human Activity Recognition using accelerometer sensor data for x, y and z axis.
### Files
The repository contains
* Keras implementation of the CNN "HAR.py"
* The dataset used for training "actitracker_raw.txt"
* Pretrained model "model.h5", and
* Readme "README.md"
The classification accuracy of the network is approximately 88%.
### Tools Required

Python 3.6 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:
* Keras 2.*
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

### Dataset

The dataset we used for this project was released by Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) Lab and can be found on this [[link]](http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php)
