## Human Activity Recognition using CNN in Keras
This project is to create a small and simple Convolutional Neural Network for Human Activity Recognition using accelerometer sensor data for x, y and z axis.

### Tools Required

Python 2.7 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

### Dataset

The dataset we used for this project was released by Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) Lab and can be found on this [[link]](http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php)
